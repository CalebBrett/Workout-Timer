# Workout-Timer
A program made to help me do different stretches and exercises for the right amount of time.
I made a file with my routine consisting of a time in minutes and a stretch or exercises. 
This way I can easily add more and change the routine without editing code.
The program is a console application which reads the file, diesplays the activity, and waits for the specified time where it then moves on to the next activity.
